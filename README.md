# Pisgah Astronomical Research Institute

PARI is a not-for-profit public organization that inspires everyone, from students to scientists, to discover their next big thing.

Space sciences and their underlying disciplines touch every aspect of new technology development.

From food to communication, transportation to public safety, space is the next frontier and exploring it has become more important than ever.  If we don’t arm future explorers with what they need to reach the next frontier, they’ll miss opportunities and be left behind.

PARI can help inspire and prepare today’s learners for tomorrow’s exciting challenges.
